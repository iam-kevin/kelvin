## About

Project was done as part of a university project

This app is an interface for the other projects [Kelvin-server](https://github.com/iam-kevin/kelvin-bounce-server) (Main Server), and other subsystem which are also AI powered. To create a system that would ideally help your local swahili farmer, work with simple agriculture related issues, including.
- Asking for the weather
- Taking a picture of a wheat / tomato leaf, to figure out whether or not it is healthy or not
